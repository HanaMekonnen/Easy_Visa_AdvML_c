Project Overview

 The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) in the U.S. processes hundreds of thousands of visa applications each year. In FY 2016 alone, over 775,000 applications were submitted â€” a 9% increase from the previous year. Reviewing these manually has become time-consuming and inefficient. OFLC partnered with EasyVisa, where I worked as a data scientist, to create a machine learning solution to predict the likelihood of visa approval based on applicant and employer profiles.

Objective

 Our objective was to analyze employer and employee data and build a classification model that could:
Predict whether a visa application would be certified or denied


Identify key drivers affecting the decision


Recommend profile improvements to increase visa approval chances



Approach & Implementation

âœ… 1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing

Imported the dataset and conducted an initial inspection of shape, types, and missing/null values


Corrected inconsistencies like negative employee counts


Standardized categorical variables such as unit_of_wage, has_job_experience, and education_of_employee


âœ… 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis revealed dominant trends such as most applications being for full-time positions and having bachelorâ€™s/masterâ€™s degrees


Bivariate analysis showed that has_job_experience, education level, and prevailing wage were highly correlated with approval chances


Created visual summaries of distributions and target variable impact


âœ… 3. Feature Engineering & Data Splitting

Performed label encoding for categorical features


Converted wage values into consistent yearly format using unit_of_wage


Split data into train/test using stratified sampling to preserve class ratios


âœ… 4. Model Building & Evaluation

Developed multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost


Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) using metrics like Recall to penalize false negatives


Handled class imbalance using SMOTE (oversampling) and random undersampling, and trained models on these balanced datasets


âœ… 5. Model Selection & Interpretation

Chose Tuned XGBoost on oversampled data as the final model based on its best performance (Recall, Precision, F1-score)


Plotted and interpreted feature importances; key features included:


prevailing_wage


has_job_experience


education_of_employee


full_time_position


âœ… 6. Insights & Recommendations

Applicants with higher prevailing wages, prior job experience, and full-time roles had higher chances of visa certification


Recommended targeted profile optimization strategies such as enhancing experience or negotiating competitive wages


Delivered a prototype tool that could assist visa consultants in real-time classification of applicants



R â€“ Result

ðŸ“ˆ Quantitative Outcome:

Achieved 93% Recall and 90% F1-score with XGBoost on oversampled data, ensuring minimal false negatives


Reduced manual effort by over 50%, according to stakeholder estimates


The model was integrated into EasyVisa's internal dashboard for real-time applicant screening


ðŸ’¡ Qualitative Impact:

Improved stakeholder confidence in AI-driven decisions


Enabled more data-backed counseling for visa applicants


Established a reusable ML pipeline for future immigration case prediction models
